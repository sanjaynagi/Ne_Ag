Building DAG of jobs...
Using shell: /bin/bash

Rules claiming more threads will be scaled down.
Job counts:

Waiting at most 5 seconds for missing files.
Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
MissingOutputException in line 98 of /home/sanj/ag1000g/Ne_Ag/Snakefile:
Missing files after 5 seconds:
analysis/LDNe/Ag_LDNe_GM_3L.out
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
